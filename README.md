# Intelligent Contracts Workshop
This repository contains the following assets required to execute the Inteligent Contracts Workshop:<br>
1)<b> Intelligent-Contracts.zip</b> - Import this zip file when creating a new  IBM Watson Studio Project<br>
It will include the following project assets:<br>
<ul>
  <li>3 CSV files - Scored_Contracts.csv, Contract_Analysis.csv, Unscored_Contracts.csv</li>
  <li>Python Notebook - ContractSuccessRandomForest-Py38 Using Sklearn - Using Open Source SkLearn Python with a Random Forest Model deployed to IBM Platform</li>
  <li>AutoAI Experiment - Automate the model selection process and open data science to citizen data scientists</li>
  <li>Modeler Flow - Build and deploy the same Python model without the need fof coding</li>
  <li>Dashboard - Historical and Predictive Visualizations using structured and unstructered contract data </li>
</ul>
2) <b>Intelligent-Contracts-Workshop-Guide.pdf</b> - Use step by step to:<br>
<ul>
<li>Automate Contract Workflow (Ingestion, Analysis, Approvals)<br>
     Uses Cloud Pak For Business Automation</li>
<li>b) Enrich Intelligence Accuracy (Extracting Information from Contracts)<br>
     Uses Cloud Pak For Data Watson Discovery</li>
<li>c) Integrate Continuous Improvement (Infusing AI into the Operation)<br>
     Uses Cloud Pak For Data Watson Studio</li>
  </ul>
3) <b>data_science_modelops_team_sport.png</b> ModelOps as a Team Sport image depicting all those involved in delivering AI models and how IBM has them all collaborate together on one platform.<br>
4) <b>contracts.zip</b> Sample contracts used in demo with Watson Discovery and used in the modelOps workflow.
